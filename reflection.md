1. What roles does a database have in web apps?

When we are working with web apps, it can be cumbersome to store all of the data we want to use as variables or objects directly in our code. Also, as data can change rapidly, storage of data within our code can result in slow and outdated data retrieval. For this reason, the best practice, when handling large amounts of data, is to store said data remotely and then call it into our model layer upon execution.

2. Why do we need to use the SQL language?

SQL is a very important language within information and data science as it is the most common language used to interface with databases. By writing a few lines of SQL code, we can select all of the correct data from a database and retrieve said data so that we can use it for web applications, data analysis, or other use cases.
